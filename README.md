This project provides a framework to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph using reinforcement learning algorithms. The main algorithms implemented are **Q-learning**, **SARSA**, and **SARSA(λ)**. These algorithms are used to find optimal paths by learning from the graph's structure, where edges have weights representing distances or costs.

## Features

- **Q-learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal policy for pathfinding.
- **SARSA**: A model-free on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, similar to Q-learning but differs in how it updates the Q-values.
- **SARSA(λ)**: A variant of SARSA with eligibility traces, providing faster convergence for certain problems.
- **Graph Visualization**: The library includes built-in support to visualize graphs before and after running reinforcement learning algorithms, showing the learned path from the start node to the destination.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - `networkx` - for creating and manipulating graphs.
   - `matplotlib` - for visualizing graphs.
   - `numpy` - for numerical computations.
   - `random` - for random number generation.
   
   You can install these dependencies via `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Place the Python script (e.g., `pathfinder.py`) in your project folder.

## Usage

To use the **PathFinder** framework to find the shortest path in a graph, you need to:

1. **Define your graph**: The graph is defined using a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v, weight)`, representing an undirected edge from node `u` to node `v` with the specified weight (or distance).

2. **Run the pathfinding algorithm**: Call the `shortestpathfinder()` function with the desired parameters.

### Example

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Define edges with weights (distance between nodes)
    edges = [
        (0, 1, 1), (0, 3, 1), (4, 2, 2), (4, 1, 2), 
        (4, 8, 1), (4, 9, 2), (2, 3, 1), (2, 6, 2), 
        (2, 5, 1), (5, 6, 2), (7, 8, 1), (7, 5, 2), 
        (2, 10, 3), (10, 6, 1), (8, 9, 3), (8, 11, 1), 
        (9, 11, 1)  # Only one direction for the edges
    ]
    
    # Run the pathfinder for the defined edges using Q-learning
    shortestpathfinder(
        edges, 
        start_node=0, 
        aim_node=11, 
        RL_algorithm='q_learning',  # Choose from 'q_learning', 'sarsa', 'sarsa_lambda'
        epsilon=0.02,  # Exploration rate
        plot=True,  # Enable graph visualization
        num_epoch=300  # Number of training episodes
    )
```

## Algorithm Details

- **Q-learning**
  
Q-learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns the optimal action-value function without requiring the environment to follow the same policy. The agent updates the Q-values by using the Bellman equation:

$Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]$

Where:
- $( Q(s, a) )$ is the Q-value for state $( s )$ and action $( a )$,
- $( \alpha )$ is the learning rate,
- $( R )$ is the reward received after taking action $( a )$ in state $( s )$,
- $( \gamma )$ is the discount factor for future rewards,
- $( \max_{a'} Q(s', a') )$ is the maximum Q-value for the next state $( s' )$.

The agent explores the environment using an **epsilon-greedy** strategy, balancing exploration (random actions) with exploitation (choosing the action with the highest Q-value).

- **SARSA**
  
SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy algorithm, meaning it updates Q-values based on the action the agent actually takes, rather than the optimal action (like Q-learning). The SARSA update rule is:

$Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]$

Where:
- $( Q(s, a) )$ is the Q-value for state $( s )$ and action $( a )$,
- $( R )$ is the reward received,
- $( \gamma )$ is the discount factor,
- $( Q(s', a') )$ is the Q-value for the next state $( s' )$ and action $( a' )$.

SARSA uses an **epsilon-greedy** policy to choose actions, exploring with a probability of $( \epsilon )$ and exploiting the best action with probability $( 1 - \epsilon )$.

- **SARSA(λ)**
  
SARSA(λ) is an extension of SARSA that incorporates **eligibility traces** to allow faster learning by updating multiple state-action pairs during a single transition. The eligibility trace acts as a memory, allowing previous state-action pairs to contribute to the update. The update rule is:

$Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right] \cdot E(s, a)$

$E(s, a) \leftarrow \gamma \lambda E(s, a)$

Where:
- $( E(s, a) )$ is the eligibility trace for state $( s )$ and action $( a )$,
- $( \lambda )$ is the trace decay factor $(0 ≤ \( \lambda ) ≤ 1)$, controlling how much influence previous state-action pairs have on updates.

SARSA(λ) enhances learning by updating not just the current state-action pair but also previously visited state-action pairs, speeding up the convergence process.

## Application

**Pathfinding in Graphs**

The primary application of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms implemented in this project—**Q-learning**, **SARSA**, and **SARSA(λ)**—is to find the optimal path in a weighted graph. These algorithms can be applied to a wide range of pathfinding problems, such as:

1. **Logistics and Supply Chain**: In logistics and supply chain management, reinforcement learning (RL) can be leveraged to optimize the routing of goods through a network of distribution centers and transportation routes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent distribution centers or warehouses, while the edges represent transportation routes, each with varying costs such as time, fuel consumption, or shipping expenses. Using RL algorithms like Q-learning or SARSA, an agent can learn to navigate this network, adjusting routes dynamically based on real-time factors such as traffic, weather, or demand fluctuations. The agent’s goal is to minimize overall delivery time, reduce transportation costs, or balance both objectives, making the supply chain more efficient and cost-effective. Over time, the agent refines its decisions through trial and error, continuously improving its routing strategy based on past experiences.

2. **Route Planning**: RL algorithms can be used in navigation systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles or robotics) to determine the most efficient route between two points in a road network, factoring in travel costs or distances as edge weights.

3. **Network Optimization**: In computer networks or communication systems, these algorithms can help in optimizing data routing, where each edge may represent latency, bandwidth, or cost, and the goal is to find the most efficient communication path.

4. **Games and Simulations**: Pathfinding algorithms are widely used in video games for AI agents to find the shortest or most strategic path across a game map. These algorithms can simulate decision-making in dynamic environments, such as in maze-solving or combat scenarios.

**Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Environments**

The RL algorithms presented here are particularly valuable in dynamic and uncertain environments where the agent must learn through trial and error. For example:

- **Energy-efficient Routing**: In sensor networks or drone delivery systems, RL can optimize energy consumption by finding paths that balance distance with power efficiency.
- **Dynamic Traffic Management**: In real-time traffic systems, RL can dynamically adjust routes for vehicles based on changing traffic conditions, accidents, or road closures.
- **Robotic Path Planning**: In robotics, an agent can use these RL algorithms to plan paths while navigating through unknown or complex terrains, adjusting its strategy based on learned experiences from the environment.

These algorithms provide powerful tools for optimization in real-world applications, where the environment is not fully known upfront, and the agent must learn from interactions.

## Conclusion

The **ShortestPathFinder** framework offers a simple yet powerful way to apply reinforcement learning to pathfinding problems in graphs. By visualizing both the initial graph and the learned path, users can gain insights into the algorithm's performance and decision-making process.
